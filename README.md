## 2. How to use these icons or images?

To use these icons or images in your project, read the [License File](LICENSE) first to know how to use it in your project.

After you read the [License](LICENSE), Here are the instructions depending on what you need:

### A single image

1. Navigate to the file you need.
2. Click on the "Download Raw File" button.
3. Finally, after it downloads, you have obtained the file you need!

### The whole pack

1. Download the latest version of **Git** [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) that is supported for your OS.
2. Follow the installation instructions.
3. After **Git** is downloaded and added to PATH, you are ready to continue.
4. Create a folder for all of your icons & images, eg. "Bloxd.io Icons".
5. Open your computer's terminal or command line.
6. In the terminal or command line, navigate to the location of your folder.
7. Type `git clone https://github.com/Pillagerplayz/Bloxd.io-Icons.git` on the command line.
8. Run it by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
9. Wait for it to complete.
10. And boom, you have the complete directory of Bloxd.io's icons and images!

I also instructions for potato computers or if you don't want to install anything.

If you have a faster computer, I recommend using **Git** for speed and efficiency. It is also okay if you don't want to install anything, but it is not that efficient to do.

I can also understand if you have a potato computer that can't handle the installation of **Git**. But I don't really know how your computer can run Bloxd if it is that slow... /:

Anyway, here is the instructions for the other way:

1. Look for the "Code" button near the top right of the file list.
2. Click it and a dropdown should appear.
3. Click the "Download ZIP" button. The download should start shortly.
4. Once the download is done, look for the downloaded file.
5. Extract the ZIP to the location you want the pack to be in, eg. Bloxd.io Icons.
6. Once the operation completes, you are done!
